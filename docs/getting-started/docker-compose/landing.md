title: Installing Honeytrap Server
---

Playing with Honeytrap is the easiest by just starting our docker image. The image is automatically being built by the continuous integration of our master branch.

This part consist of four steps:

1. First, install [docker and docker-compose](/docs/getting-started/docker-compose/install-docker/).
1. Next, setup the [prerequisites](/docs/getting-started/docker-compose/setup-prerequisites/).
1. Then, run the [docker-compose](/docs/getting-started/docker-compose/setup-honeytrap-server/) scripts.
1. Lastly, start the [Honeytrap Agent](/docs/getting-started/docker-compose/run-agent).
