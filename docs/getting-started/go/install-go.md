title: Install Go
---

Installing Go is as easy as downloading and extracting a file:

```
$ cd /usr/local
$ wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar vxf go1.9.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

#### Installation from source

After installing Go, make sure to compile/install the Honeytrap Agent, as explained [here](/docs/getting-started/go/installation-from-source/).
